### Key goals for the week are the following:

- Pain of manual processes and how to optimise them
- Linking threat models and sub-threat models together
- Creating threat model templates for security patterns
- Define a taxonomy of terms (to be sent out prior to summit as RFC)
- Better threat model diffing
- Integration into DevOps
- Use of output by downstream systems... development, test, deployment, etc
- Making the infrastructure and system (as opposed to just software) threat modeling more mature
- re-defining a sSDLC for better threat model utilisation
- Unified input and output in a sSDLC
- Simplifying threat modeling for business environments
- Scaling threat models throughout an organization (central storage, versioning control, etc)
- Automating threat models

**Threat Modeling Workshop ideas**

(some can be consolidated in one workshop)

- pain of manual processes and how to optimise them
- linking threat models and sub-threat models together
- creating threat model templates for security patterns
- better threat model diffing
- integration into DevOps
- use of output by downstream systems... development, test, deployment, etc
- making the infrastructure and system (as opposed to just software) threat modeling more mature
- integration of common taxonomies that are useful across multiple sSDL tiers (not just threat modeling)
- are threat trees actually useful in live business environments
- unified input and output in a sSDL
- simplifying threat modeling for business environments
- Scaling threat models throughout an organization (central storage, versioning control, etc)
- Automating threat models
- Splitting up threat models integration into domain-agnostic and domain-specific
- Enabling Security champions to perform domain agnostic threat models
